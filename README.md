## Question Generator

Made by Tomislav Ignjatov

## Description
Simple Python script that is used for inputing questions and 4 different answers and insert it into a docx file using a nice tabbing.

## Usage 
I used this script as a way to write questions for some classes of mine with answers in order to later test my knowledge before the exam.

It saves time instead of tabbing in Microsoft Words here you just focus on the questions and answers and script makes it look good.
